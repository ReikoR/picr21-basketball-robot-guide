= Schematic

== Reference designators

Reference designators are unique identifiers for each component.
For example U1, R2, D2.
Designators are usually prefixed with a letter or letters, that correspond to component's type.
Prefix is followed by a number, so that the letter and number combination is unique on the entire schematic.
Prefixes can be usually specified in component library.

Common prefixes:

* U or IC - integrated circuit. For example microcontroller, motor driver or voltage regulator.
* R - resistor.
* C - capacitor.
* D - diode or LED (light emitting diode).
* LED - light emitting diode.
* L - inductor.
* Q - transistor.
* J or CON - connector.
* S - switch.

== Connections

=== Labels

Use labels on nets instead of drawing long wires between components.

=== Supply connections

Avoid connecting all the power supply pins together. Use power supply symbols instead.

== Decoupling capacitors

It is recommended to connect a decoupling (bypass) capacitor close to each power input pin.
Common capacitance value is 100 nF.
On a schematic, the capacitors can be connected directly to the power pin.
Or they can be connected together close to the component when the component has multiple decoupling capacitors
and there is not enough room to directly wire them to the component.
