=== Firmware

==== Binary firmware file

link:https://github.com/ReikoR/picr21-basketball-robot-guide/raw/master/source/electronics/picr21-NUCLEO-adapter-firmware.bin[picr21-NUCLEO-adapter-firmware.bin]

Connect NUCLEO to a computer and drag or copy the *.bin file on the NOD_G431KB drive.

==== Sending commands to mainboard

Struct in firmware

[source,c,tabsize=2]
----
typedef struct Command {
  int16_t speed1;
  int16_t speed2;
  int16_t speed3;
  uint16_t throwerSpeed;
  uint16_t delimiter;
} Command;
----

Using with python's link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html[struct library]

[source,python,tabsize=4]
----
struct.pack('<hhhHH', speed1, speed2, speed3, thrower_speed, 0xAAAA)
----

==== Receiving data from mainboard

Struct in firmware

[source,c,tabsize=2]
----
typedef struct Feedback {
  int16_t speed1;
  int16_t speed2;
  int16_t speed3;
  uint16_t delimiter;
} Feedback;
----

Using with python's link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html[struct library]

[source,python,tabsize=4]
----
actual_speed1, actual_speed2, actual_speed3, feedback_delimiter = struct.unpack('<hhhH', received_data)
